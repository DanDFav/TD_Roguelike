Positives.... none? 

Negatives: 
Way too much going on between every round, should i change my workers? is this set of workers the best for this round? or should i change it considering im low on wood? 
Oh now this round i pick a modifier that effects the next 5 rounds, oh this round a generic hero with completely random everything, oh cool he has two useless skills that are uninspired. 

Towers lack personality, 
	- Arrow tower is a one hit kill on a single basic enemy?? One hit kill so early felt really dissatisfying 
	- Tesla tower kills a basic enemy and deals damage to a chained enemy? is this not just a strict upgrade? 
	- Mortar tower just felt useless 
	- tornado tower was just a different type of chain attack, didnt feel like anything. 
	

the expanding map doesnt feel all that fun, i like the idea of having splash damage at the front to clear out the larger hordes of weaker enemies, then having higher single-target dps just behind that to kill the stronger enemies who made it through. but now the map is always changing in a not so fun way, done better in rogue tower  

Why is it so costly to unlock new towers? run 4 and i only have 5 towers? yet im forced to use every tower every run since the more you have of 1 tower the more it cost. Feels lazy. and bad.

Every single page is just way too much info 

When i first died and saw the meta progression tree it killed all urges to play the game more, definitely felt that skill had way less to do with everything, it was much meta based. 

City building sucked too.
